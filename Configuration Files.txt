An advanced user of ReconFTW is the master of the config files for the framework and its underlying tools. 
The ReconFTW config file is also where you can tune, globally, what kind of enumeration and scanning the tool does.

You can control how fast it scans, proxy settings, which vuln checks, which wordlists, which ports, timeout options, etc.
