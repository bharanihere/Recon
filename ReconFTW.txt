Anti Recon - ReconFTW

#Recon is important, but some people hate it. I get it.
When you're in the zone & ready to pounce on a target, you just want to start hacking.
Want the best of both worlds? Quick/complete recon, WITH great coverage?

This gives you a complete picture of an orgs subdomains & starts some cursory analysis of them.
Doing this individually is time-consuming. So...
 for the 
⭐️  low-low cost of the initial setup time ⭐️ 
you can get GREAT recon++ & you don’t have to be a recon-head to get it!

ReconFTW automates the process of recon for you. 
It performs “recon++” & can be used to run some cursory automated vulnerability checks like XSS, Open Redirects, SSRF, CRLF, LFI, SQLi, & more.
